#### Rules of the MJYY Server (Second Edition)(including but not limited to the following points)

* Please use signs or other means to declare the owner of private property and construction land. Once the declared object is confirmed valid, it will be regarded as the player's private asset and protected by the server.
* Maliciously destroying others' private property and construction land (as stipulated in the first point) is prohibited. If the destruction of a player's asset that has been confirmed to exist is not related to construction land, it will be treated as the destruction of private property.
* It is forbidden to damage the ecological environment of the main city and its surrounding areas or to damage the environment outside the main city, which affects the gaming experience of other players.
* To maintain everyone's gaming experience, the server prohibits actions that increase server load during peak hours (such as fast map running, large machines, etc.).
* It is forbidden to insult others, make personal attacks, or send vulgar words in the server or group. If the remarks cause mental damage to server members, it will be treated as a personal attack.

* Violation of the above terms (including but not limited to the first five points, excluding the situation stipulated in the tenth point) will result in a warning. A second warning or ban will be given based on the nature of the damage and the attitude of admitting the mistake.
* If you believe that the administrator has exercised their management rights incorrectly, you can submit an application for review to the administrator. This clause does not apply to violations of the tenth point or extremely bad attitudes.
